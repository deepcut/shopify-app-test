# How to alter the header meta tag

## 1. Authenticate into developer store

1. Visit developer account at: [developers.shopify.com](developers.shopify.com)
2. Log in
3. On the left-hand side, click "Development stores"
4. Click the first store and make sure it works.
5. Future apps + plugins will appear under "Apps" on the lower left

## 2. Access theme file via API

1. Make sure your `.env` file is present and has these vars

```
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
SHOPIFY_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

2. Visit `localhost:3000` and type in the store URL - `bicep-photography.myshopify.com`. This will be stored as a `Shop` record in the db.
2. When you hit localhost:3000, the session will already be authenticated with the store. You can start playing around by putting `binding.pry` in `HomeController#index`.

## 3. Figure out how to modify the theme file and re-upload it into the user's store

1. Get the current liquid file by

```
res = ShopifyAPI::Asset.find('layout/theme.liquid')
res.value
```

2. Figure out a way to insert a meta tag RIGHT before the `</head>` tag as follows:

```
{%- if template.name == 'product' -%}
  <meta content="https://example.com/?meta=#{some_key_product_info}" property="og:image">
{%- endif -%}
```

3. Encode some key product info into the `?meta` key, such as title, description, and price. If you wanna see how it's done in the liquid code, take a look by typing the following. This is key b/c the returned image will contain info given in the meta key.

`ShopifyAPI::Asset.find('snippets/social-meta-tags.liquid').value`

4. For further info on the "Assets" API, take a look at

- [Shopify gem repo](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_api)
- [Gem doc](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/Shopify/shopify_api/ShopifyAPI/Asset)

5. Once you figure out how to do this, you could put a button in the Home#index view that hits another route, which will do the modification.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

1. When the shop owner clicks on a button, our app should modify his app's theme file by inserting the meta tag specified above.
2. ONLY on individual product pages, we should see a `og:image` meta tag right before the `</head>` tag.

## Keep in mind

- Make sure to preserver the original liquid theme value just in case we need to revert.
